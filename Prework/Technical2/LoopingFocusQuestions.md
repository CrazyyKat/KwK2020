# Focus Questions - Looping

1. What is the purpose of a for-in loop?
2. How many times will the code inside of a for-in loop run?
3. Where might an application that you use, implement something like a for-in loop? Explain.

## What is the purpose of a for-in loop?

A `for...in`/`for-in` statement/loop iterates over the items in a collection (array/dictionary), range of numbers, or characters in a string.

## How many times will the code inside of a for-in loop run?

It will run as many times as the number of items in the dictionary it is iterating over.

## Where might an application that you use, implement something like a for-in loop? Explain.

You might want to implement a for-in loop when you are creating a high score list. The high scores could be saved like in a dictionary `["date1": 2132, "date2": 25325, "date3": 231241]` and then you can use a for-in loop to place the high scores in list ordered by the date the score was made.
