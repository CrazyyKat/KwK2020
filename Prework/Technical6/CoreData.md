# Focus Questions - Core Data

1. What CRUD actions does your favorite or most-used mobile app have, and when does it take those actions?
2. What’s an example of offlining that you’ve noticed on an app that you use?
3. What an analogy that helps you wrap your mind around this relationship between the app, Core Data, and a back-end? Or, one that you might share with scholars?

## What CRUD actions does your favorite or most-used mobile app have, and when does it take those actions?

Well, I use twitter and instagram a TONNN. Twitter and Insta both allow user to post images or tweets. Then other users can interact with those posts either with comments or retweeting. On instagram, you can watch a person's story, while on twitter, you can view another user's tweets. You can look at the profiles of other people on both apps and you can edit your profiles on both apps.

## What’s an example of offlining that you’ve noticed on an app that you use?

Sometimes, when I am on a flight, I forget that I can't use facebook. However, I can still open the app out of habit and scroll a decent amount on my news feed before the app stops loading new posts.

## What an analogy that helps you wrap your mind around this relationship between the app, Core Data, and a back-end? Or, one that you might share with scholars?

Core Data allows us to have data persistence, meaning the data stays around even after we close the app.
