# Focus Questions - Conditionals Lesson

1. Provide an example of where/when a real web application that probably uses a conditional
2. List 3 operators and explain what each of them does. Which is the newest or more interesting to you?
3. What is the difference between = and ==?

##  Provide an example of where/when a real web application that probably uses a conditional

If you do to the desktop version of Instagram without being logged in, it will ask you to log in. So the conditional there is something like below:

>If the user is logged in, then let user continue to website. Else ask user to log in. If user does not have an account, then ask user to sign up.

## List 3 operators and explain what each of them does. Which is the newest or more interesting to you?

* `!=` is used to denote not equal to
* `==` is used to denote equal to
* `%` is used to find out if two numbers have a remainder when they are divided

For me, I personally love `==`. I use it obsessively when I code conditionals for one of the classes I am in this semester. When I want code to run when a boolean is true, I always make sure that I write that if statement to only run if the `boolean == true` (class is in java). In Swift, I love/hate that it is case sensitive, because  it requires me to pay more attention to my code.

## What is the difference between = and ==?
 `=` is used when creating variables. It sets the variable to something. Whereas `==` is used as a form of logic and denotes that something is equal to another thing. `==` will also return a true or false because it is trying to determine if what you typed on both sides of the `==` are exactly the same (this is case sensitive). You would say `var x = 3` with the system returning nothing but if you would say `2 == 2.0` the system would return false.
