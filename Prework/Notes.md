# Notes

This document is where I will be typing my notes as I do the pre-work for this summer's Swift curriculum.


## Technical Vocabulary

The following terms appeared in a lesson as important vocabulary.

* **camelCase**: when a variable is named something that is multiple words, lowercase for the first word and capitalize the first letter of the following word(s)
	* var **lastName** = "Williams"
* **constant**:  defined by `let` a constant is a variable that will never change
	* `let firstName = "Ashanti"`
* **double**:  a number that has a decimal, cannot be combined with an integer/float
* **integer**:  a number without a decimal, cannot be combined with a double (sometimes referred to as a float)
* **interpolation**: including variable information in an output
	* ![Interpolation](Photos/Interpolation.png)
* **keyword**: special reserved words in a language  
* **string**: a series of characters between two double quote marks
	* `"hello!"`
* **variable**: defined by `var` followed by the name of the variable and what the variable is
	* `var name = "Ashanti"`
* **argument**:When you call a function that has an argument, it means that the function needs some sort of value to run. For example I created the following function and the argument here is the Int after numberOfPencils.
	* `func colorPencils(numberOfPencils : Int) {...`
* **call/run**: telling a function to do its specific job
* **declare**: assigning a function a specific ob
* **function**: an action in the code
* **parameter**: parameters are the information located in the parenthesis immediately following the name of a function
* **return value**: the value that is the result of a function being run. It is stored for use later on in the code.

| `let [name of constant] =` | sets a constant (unchanging variable) equal to something |                                     |
| `print ()`                 | prints to the console                                    |                                     |
