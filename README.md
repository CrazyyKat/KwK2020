# KwK2020
Everything in this git repo is related to what I utilized and did while working at Kode With Klossy in the summer of 2020. I have the privilege of working as a Swift instructor again this summer!!

In general, there is a pre-work folder. In that folder, there are folders for each week of technical work in addition to a markdown file called [https://github.com/aawilliams94/KwK2020/blob/master/Prework/Notes.md](Notes). The notes file contains all of my notes as I worked through the pre-work. The purpose of that file is to have 1 running document with any information I might need on hand.

When the time comes, I will be adding another folder with all of the different practice elements from each of the lessons and a folder specifically for my projects.
