# KwK2020
Everything in here is related to what I did for this summer working with Kode With Klossy. I had the priviledge of working as a Swift instructor again this summer!!

In general, there is a Prework folder. In that folder, there are the technical folders for each week of technical work in addition to a markdown file called Notes. The notes file contains all of my notes as I worked through the prework.

I will be adding another folder with all of the different practice elements from each of the lessons and a folder specifically for my projects.
